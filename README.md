## Description
For thousands of years, people have created beautiful patterns through intricate needlework.
Many of these patterns utilize algorithmic concepts like repetition, recursion and variation to build complex motives from simple rules.
In this talk, we explore the art of embroidery through Python programming and show how you can create your own patterns with code.

We will turn straightforward commands into elaborate and intricate artworks with loops, randomness and recursive functions using only the built-in turtle library in Python.
Then, we will show how you can turn your art into embroidery patterns that are readable by an embroidery machine using the TurtleThread library and how you can use Python to create decorative ornaments for your Christmas tree.
This talk is for anyone interested in the intersection between Python programming, creative coding and arts and crafts!
